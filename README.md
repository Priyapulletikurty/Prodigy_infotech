🔍 Exploring Machine Learning with Predictive Modeling! 🏠
I'm excited to share that as part of my internship with [Prodigy InfoTech], I've been working on a fascinating project involving house price prediction using linear regression. The model considers key parameters such as area, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms to estimate property values.
This project has been a fantastic opportunity to deepen my understanding of machine learning algorithms and their real-world applications. .
